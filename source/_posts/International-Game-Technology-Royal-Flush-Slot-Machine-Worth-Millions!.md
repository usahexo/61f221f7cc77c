#  International Game Technology Royal Flush Slot Machine Worth Millions!

## Slot machines account for a major percentage of casino gambling revenues. The games are known as "one-armed bandits" because they used to take all of the player's money, but modern machines are more user-friendly.

# One of the most popular slot machine designs is the royal flush. These games use poker symbols and typically have five reels with between 20 and 30 pay lines. They can be found in both online and offline casinos.

## A royal flush is a hand in poker that consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. The ace is high and the two is low. In a royal flush machine, this hand is the jackpot, and typically pays out 10,000 to 1 odds when it hits.

#Royal flush machines are not commonly found in casinos, but when they are available they are always major attractions. In fact, there is one such machine currently on display at the International Game Technology (IGT) headquarters in Las Vegas. This particular machine is worth an estimated $2 million!

## The royal flush machine at IGT was originally manufactured by Bally Technologies, but the company was recently acquired by IGT. As part of the acquisition, IGT has agreed to keep the machine on public display for at least six months.

# So if you're ever in Las Vegas and see an imposing metal cabinet with "Royal Flush" emblazoned on the front, be sure to stop by and give it a spin!
