#  What is the chemical name of Krypton? 

The chemical name for Krypton is krypton-84.

#  What is the melting point of Krypton? 

Krypton has a melting point of -153 degrees Celsius, which means that it is a gas at room temperature. This makes it an unsuitable material for many everyday applications.

#  What is the boiling point of Krypton? 

Krypton boils at -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or -273.14 degrees Celsius. This means that it is a liquid at room temperature.

#  What are the uses of Krypton? 

Krypton is a gas that is mainly used in fluorescent lamps and energy-efficient light bulbs. It is also used in lasers and other medical devices.

#  What are the health and environmental effects of Krypton?

Primarily, krypton is an inert gas that doesnâ€™t react with other elements. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. As a result, it has few known health hazards associated with it. However, krypton may displace oxygen in the air and lead to suffocation. It can also cause asphyxiation if it displaces enough nitrogen in a confined area. In addition, krypton is heavier than air and may accumulate in low-lying areas, leading to dangerous conditions.

When released into the environment, krypton quickly dissipates and has a very low impact. However, if released in large quantities, it could potentially cause considerable harm. For example, if a large cloud of krypton entered an enclosed space, people and animals inside could suffocate. Additionally, if krypton were to mix with water vapor, it could form an acid that could damage vegetation and property.
