#  When will the major casino sites be announced?

The website's parent company, MGM Resorts International, is expected to make a major announcement about its plans for a casino resort in Springfield next Wednesday.

The long-awaited announcement of the casino sites could come as early as next week. That's according to The Republican newspaper, quoting unnamed sources familiar with the situation.

A spokesman for MGM Springfield declined to comment on the report.

MGM has been mum about its plans for the $800 million casino resort project, even as it has continued construction on the downtown site.

The Las Vegas-based company is believed to be one of two finalists for the lone western Massachusetts casino license. The other bidder is Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, which is operated by Penn National Gaming Inc.

If MGM is selected, it would mark a return to Springfield for the gaming giant, which shuttered its slot parlor at the now- demolished former Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.
