#  How to Spice Up Your Roulette Drinking Game with a Touch of Dolores Del Rio Style

Are you looking for a new and exciting way to spice up your roulette drinking game? If so, you may want to consider adding a touch of Dolores Del Rio style. This legendary Hollywood actress was known for her sense of style and flair, and her approach to roulette drinking can add an extra bit of excitement to your next game night.

To get started, you'll need to gather a few supplies. In addition to your roulette wheel and set of playing cards, you'll also need a bottle of tequila, some salt, and a lime. If you're feeling particularly frisky, you can also add in a few shot glasses for those who want to take their game up a notch.

Once you have your supplies ready, it's time to get started. First, place the bottle of tequila in the center of the table. Then, divide the players into two teams - red and black - alternating teams as you go around the table.

Next, each player takes a turn spinning the wheel. Whatever color it lands on is that player's team for the next round. Once everyone has had a chance to spin the wheel, it's time for the action to begin.

The first player on each team starts by taking a shot of tequila. Then, they must put their hand on the table and lick their salty hand before taking another shot. Finally, they must bite into the lime before taking their final shot. The second player then takes their turn completing the same steps.

The goal is to finish all four shots as quickly as possible - and without vomiting! The first team to finish wins the round and gets one point. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!

If this sounds like too much fun (or if you just don't have enough players), you can always modify the game rules accordingly. For example, players could simply drink one shot each instead of completing all four steps. Or, if you're feeling really daring, why not try playing with no shots at all? Simply eating a slice of lime after licking your salty hand will give you that extra zing while playing!
