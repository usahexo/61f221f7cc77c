#  How To Report Illegal Gambling Machines In Pennsylvania

If you believe that there is an illegal gambling machine in your area, you may be wondering what to do about it. In this article, we will discuss how to report an illegal gambling machine in Pennsylvania.

The first thing you need to do is gather evidence of the illegal gambling machine. This can include photos or videos of the machine in action, as well as any documentation you may have of its ownership or operation.

Once you have gathered evidence, you can contact your local law enforcement agency and provide them with the evidence. They will then investigate the matter and determine if there is a case to be made against the owner or operator of the gambling machine.

If you are not comfortable contacting law enforcement yourself, you can also contact the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office Gambling Enforcement Division and ask them to investigate the matter.

It is important to remember that simply having an illegal gambling machine in your area is not a crime. The crime is operating or owning the machine without a license. So, if law enforcement does not believe that there is enough evidence to make a case against the owner or operator, they may not take any action.

However, if you do have evidence of an illegal gambling machine in your area, it is important to report it so that authorities can take appropriate action.

That resident is Mark, who lives in a small town outside of Pittsburgh. About two years ago, Mark started noticing illegal gambling machines popping up all over town. He knew they were illegal because he had previously worked in the gaming industry and was familiar with the law.

#  Tips For Reporting Illegal Gambling Machines In Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania's laws about illegal gambling machines are strict, but there are ways to report these machines if you know where to look. Here are a few tips for how to report illegal gambling machines in Pennsylvania.

First, you need to identify what an illegal gambling machine looks like. Typically, these machines have flashing lights and electronic sounds that draw in gamblers. They might also be in an area where you can’t easily see who is operating them. If you suspect that a machine is an illegal gambling device, take down its exact location and write down as much information as you can about it. 

Once you have this information, you can reach out to your local law enforcement agency or the Pennsylvania State Police. Be sure to provide as much evidence as possible, such as photos or videos of the machine in operation. It’s also helpful to have information on the person operating the machine, such as their name and contact information. 

If you report an illegal gambling machine and it is seized by law enforcement, you may be eligible for a financial reward. The amount of the reward varies depending on the circumstances of each case, but it can be up to $1,000. 

Remember, if you see something suspicious, say something! Reporting illegal gambling machines helps keep our communities safe and protects innocent people from being scammed.
