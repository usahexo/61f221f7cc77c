In a survey of casino gamers in the Commonwealth of Dominica, poker has been voted the most popular game. The survey was undertaken by the Dominica Gaming Authority (DGA) to help them better understand the gaming habits of their citizens.

Poker was favoured by 45% of respondents, with blackjack coming in second at 29%. Roulette was third with 18%, followed by slot machines (13%) and other games (5%).

Commenting on the findings, DGA Director General Deborah Mordecai said, “We are not surprised by these results as poker is a very popular game all over the world. We will use this information to improve our services and ensure that our players have the best possible gaming experience.”

#  Roulette: The Game of Kings 

Roulette is one of the oldest and most popular casino games in the world. Originating in France in the 17th century, the game has evolved into several variations that are played in casinos around the world today. The basic premise of roulette is to guess where a ball will end up after being spun around a numbered wheel. Players can bet on different numbers, colors, or combinations thereof to win money.

The history of roulette is somewhat murky, but there are several theories as to how it was invented. One theory suggests that a French physicist named Blaise Pascal invented the game as a way to help destitute nobles make money. Another suggests that it was created by a benedictine monk named Brother Mathieu. However it came about, roulette quickly became popular among aristocrats and continues to be a favorite among casino-goers today.

There are several variations of roulette that are played today, but the most common version is French Roulette. This game is played with a wheel that has 37 numbered slots (0-36), plus a green slot for 0 and a red slot for 00. Players can bet on any single number, or on groups of numbers, colors, or even pairs of numbers. The payout odds vary depending on the bet made, but typically range from 2:1 (on single number bets) to 35:1 (on bets on two specific numbers).

Like other casino games, there is an element of luck involved in roulette, but there is also some skill involved in making good bets. Most casinos offer free lessons on how to play roulette if you're interested in trying your hand at this classic game.
