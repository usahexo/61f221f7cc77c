#  The Casino at the End of the World!

Las Vegas is a city that has been built and rebuilt time and time again.
In the 1800s, the area was little more than an inhospitable desert, but it was to be the perfect place for a railway town.
The railroad companies needed a stop halfway between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, so they built a depot in the middle of nowhere.
That nowhere became known as Las Vegas.

The town grew slowly at first, but it gained in popularity when Nevada became a state in 1864.
Las Vegas was now on the map, and people started to come for the gambling and the entertainment.
In 1905, Las Vegas had its first big casino: The Northern Club.
It was followed by dozens of other casinos, each one bigger and more lavish than the last.

Las Vegas quickly became known as The Gambling Capital of the World.
Casinos sprang up all over town, and people came from all over to try their luck.
The Rat Pack made Las Vegas their home in the 1950s, and they helped to make it even more famous.
In 1971, The Landmark Hotel opened its doors and set a new standard for luxury hotels in Las Vegas.
It was soon followed by The Mirage, Treasure Island, MGM Grand, New York New York, and many others.

Las Vegas is constantly changing and evolving to keep up with the latest trends.
The biggest casinos are now being replaced by smaller ones that focus on luxury experiences instead of gaming tables.
And while some of the classic casinos like The Venetian remain popular, others have had to close their doors because of the economic downturn.

Las Vegas is still a popular destination for tourists from all over the world.
You can find everything here from luxurious resorts to cheap motels on The Strip.  There's something for everyone in this glitzy city in the desert!

#  Billionaire Casino Owner Plans to Turn World's Oldest City into Gambling Mecca!

In a stunning move, casino mogul and billionaire owner Sheldon Adelson has announced plans to turn the ancient city of Jerusalem into a gambling mecca.

The $35 billion project, which is set to be completed in 2020, will include five luxury hotels, a convention center, and of course, a mega-casino.

"Jerusalem is a world-class city with a fantastic history and we are excited to bring our unique brand of entertainment to this amazing destination," said Adelson in a statement.

Critics say the project will cause massive traffic jams and increase crime rates, but Adelson is unperturbed.

"There will be some opposition, but at the end of the day people want jobs and they want to have fun," he said. "This project is going to create thousands of jobs and generate billions in revenue."

Construction on the casino is set to begin in early 2016.
