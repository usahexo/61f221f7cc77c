#  How to Play & Win the Cooter Slot Machine

The Cooter slot machine is a game that has been designed to look like a classic video game. It has three reels and five paylines, and features symbols including cherries, lemons, plums, oranges, bells, grapes, and 7s. Players can wager up to 10 coins on each payline, for a total bet of 50 coins per spin.

The Cooter slot machine offers a top payout of 2,500 coins, which can be won by landing three 7s on the central payline. Other winning combinations include two 7s (1,000 coins) and three bells (750 coins), with smaller payouts available for other combinations of symbols.

To play the Cooter slot machine, players need to first select their coin value. This can be done by pressing the left or right arrow buttons next to COIN VALUE until the desired amount is displayed on the COIN VALUE meter at the bottom of the screen. Once the coin value has been selected, players need to decide how many coins they want to bet on each payline. This can be done by pressing the up or down arrow buttons next to LINE BET until the desired amount is displayed on the LINES meter at the bottom of the screen.

Once the coin value and line bet have been set, players can spin the reels by pressing the SPIN button in the middle of the control panel. If they want to bet maximum coins on each payline, they can press AUTO PLAY to automatically spin the reels for a preset number of spins.

When all three reels have stopped spinning, any winning combinations will be highlighted and paid out according to the payout table posted above the reels. Players can choose to collect their winnings or gamble them in order to try and double their payout. To do this, they need to correctly predict whether a playing card will be red or black when it is turned over. If they guess correctly, their payout will be doubled; if they guess incorrectly, they will lose their entire winnings.
