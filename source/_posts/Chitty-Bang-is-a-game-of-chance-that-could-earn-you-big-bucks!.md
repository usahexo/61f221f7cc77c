#  Chitty Bang – the perfect game for any casino lover!

If you’re a casino lover, Chitty Bang is the perfect game for you! It’s easy to learn and provides plenty of excitement, as well as the chance to win big!

The game is played with six standard decks of cards. Two players are each dealt twelve cards, face down. The rest of the cards are placed in a stack in the middle of the table, face down. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by flipping over the top card from the deck. This card is called the starter card. The player then has two options: either take the card and add it to their hand, or place it face up on the table. If they choose to place it on the table, the next player then has the same choice. If they want to take it, they can, but they must also take any other cards that are revealed beneath it. When all of the cards have been taken, whichever player has collected the most cards (or if there is a tie) is declaredthe winner.

The aim of Chitty Bang is to collect as many cards as possible until you can go no further. The twist is that you can only collect certain types of card – either clubs or spades. Cards of other suits cannot be collected. This makes for an interesting and strategic game, as you must decide whether to take a card or not based on what suits you best.

Are you looking for ways to improve your Chitty Bang skills? Look no further! This guide is packed with tips and tricks to help you play like a pro.

# The basics

First, let's take a look at the basic rules of the game. Chitty Bang is played by throwing two dice and collecting coins according to the number shown on the dice. The first player to reach $5 or more wins the game.

If you're looking to score big points, aim for combinations like doubles or triples. You can also use your points to buy special cards which will give you an edge over your opponents.

# The best strategies

Now that you know the basics, it's time to learn some strategies! Here are a few tips to help you win more games:

* Try to collect as many coins as possible in each round. This will give you a bigger advantage over your opponents.

* Use your points wisely! Don't spend them all on cards, especially if you're not close to winning the game. Save them for later rounds when you need them most.

* Be strategic about when you choose to go out. If your opponents only have a few coins left, try waiting until they've collected more so that you can take their money away from them!

# Winning tips

Here are some final tips to help you win more games:

* Pay attention to what your opponents are doing. If they're collecting lots of coins, try to block them by landing on their spaces.
