#  Come out and play the Monkey Business Game today!

The Monkey Business Game is a great game to play today if you want to have some fun. This game is a lot of fun, and it is really easy to learn how to play it.

In the Monkey Business Game, you will be trying to collect as many bananas as possible. You can collect bananas by either landing on them or by picking them up off the ground. The player with the most bananas at the end of the game wins.

If you want to play the Monkey Business Game, then all you need is a deck of cards and some friends. To begin the game, each player will draw four cards from the deck. The player with the highest card starts the game. The player with the lowest card goes first. If both players have the same card, then they draw again until one player has a higher card than the other.

The player who starts the game will play their first card. The value of this card will determine what action they can take. If the first card is an ace, for example, then the player can either pick up a banana or take another turn. If the first card is a two, then the player can only move two spaces forward or backward on the board.

If you are able to pick up a banana, then you will put it in your hand and hold onto it until the end of the game. If you are unable to pick up a banana, then you can either move one space closer to or further away from the bananas on the board, or take another turn.

When playing this game, remember that all of your opponents are trying to get as many bananas as possible too! So make sure that you keep an eye on what everyone else is doing so that you don’t get left behind!

#  The Monkey Business Game is your chance to win big!

Monkey Business is a dice game that can be played with two to four players. The game is simple to learn, but difficult to master. To win, you must score the most points by rolling the dice and taking the best combinations.

The game starts with each player being given three dice. The player who rolls the highest number goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table. On a player's turn, they roll all of their dice and must place them in one of three possible groupings:

* A full set of three identical numbers (e.g., three threes). This is called a "triple."

* Two identical pairs (e.g., two sixes). This is called a "double."

* One number matching another number on the table (e.g., one four matched with four other fours on the table). This is called a "pair."

After rolling, the player may take one of two actions: either take all of the dice in one grouping and put them into their "monkey pot," or re-roll all of the dice and create a new grouping. If you re-roll, you cannot put any of the dice back into your monkey pot. If you put any of your dice into your monkey pot, you cannot re-roll them.

If you take all of the dice in one grouping and put them into your monkey pot, then you can no longer score any points from that grouping. For example, if you have a triple and put it into your monkey pot, then you cannot score any points from that triple on subsequent turns. However, if another player takes the triple away from your monkey pot, then they can still score points from it on their turn.

If you keep at least one die in each grouping, then you can continue to score points from those groupings on subsequent turns. For example, if you have a double and a pair, then you would keep both doubles and add the two pairs together for a total of six points (2 + 2 + 2). You could also keep all three triples for nine points (3 + 3 + 3), or mix and match however you like. The key is to remember that you can only hold onto so many doubles and/or triples at once; if you go over three total (either doubles or triples), then any extras are lost.

The game ends when one player has either run out of cards or has no more legal moves left to make. That player is then declared the winner and receives the total sum of all dice in the other players' monkey pots. In addition, bonuses may be awarded for particularly good combinations (see below).

    How to Play Monkey Business   

 Monopoly board game

 Get yourself a set of Monkey Business cards and some friends together – it’s time to get playing! The aim of Monkey Business is very simple – be the first player to amass 1000 Points! Points are scored by picking up different combinations with your 3 Dice as illustrated on your cards e.g.: Pairs (1 or 5), Triples(3 of any number), Full Houses(3 different numbers), etc – there are loads! So how do we go about collecting these Points?

   First things first: Roll all 3 Dice onto the Table in front of You . These become Your Hand for this particular turn only . In order to Score Points You will need to place them in 1of 3 possible ways : 

 - as Separate Scores : e . g . 1 4 5 becomes 1 Point , 2 6 7 becomes 2 Points etc . As soon as You have Scored with All 3 Dice You can Stop Playing this turn & Pick up Your Prize Money ! - As Pairs : 2 Doubles become 4 Points . e . g . 1 2 3 & 4 5 6 become 4 Points - As Triples : 3 Triplets become 9 Points . e . g . 1 1 1 , 2 2 2 & 3 3 3 become 9 Points

 After Rolling , & Placing All Your Dice in any Combination as above , You now have TWO Choices :

 - Take ALL Your DICE & Place Them FACE DOWN In front Not Touching Each Other as Your new Pool Called Your “ MONKEY POT ” - OR - RE- ROLL ALL OF THEM To try get Better Combinations & Scores BUT Keep ALL Your DICE where they are currently Placed

 NOTE : IF YOU Decide TO Take ALL YOUR DICE & Place Them FACE DOWN In front Not Touching Each Other as Your new Pool Called “ MONKEY POT ” THEN You CANNOT Score ANYMORE POINTS FROM THIS TURN ONWARDS AS YOU HAVE NO DICE ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF YOU TO SCORE WITH !! Any Extra Die over THREE at this Stage automatically become Null & Void
