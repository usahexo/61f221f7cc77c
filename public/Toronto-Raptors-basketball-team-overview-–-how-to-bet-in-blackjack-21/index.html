The Raptors play their home games at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario. The franchise was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA’s expansion into Canada. The team has won one division championship and have been to the playoffs six times. |</p>
<p>The current iteration of the Raptors was formed in 1998 as a result of the NBA’s expansion into Canada. At that time, the team was known as the “Vancouver Grizzlies”, and played their home games at General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Grizzlies were one of two teams added to the NBA as part of its Canadian expansion, with the other being the Toronto Raptors. The Grizzlies struggled both on and off the court during their six-year stint in Vancouver; they never made it past the first round of the playoffs, and averaged only 14,500 fans per game. </p>
<p>In 2001, after numerous attempts by then-owner Michael Heisley to relocate the team, it was announced that Memphis, Tennessee would be become the new home for the Grizzlies starting with the 2001–02 season. As part of this move, then-general manager Stu Jackson was relieved of his duties and replaced by Jerry West. In their first season in Memphis, attendance increased by nearly 3,000 fans per game, but they still failed to make it past the first round of playoffs. </p>
<p>It would not be until 2005 that they reached their first conference finals; they were swept by eventual champions San Antonio Spurs. They would not return to post-season play until 2011 when they were once again swept in four games by Allen Iverson and David West’s New Orleans Hornets. In 2013–14, they finally broke through to win their first playoff series as a fifth seed against fourth-seeded Brooklyn Nets before losing to Washington Wizards in seven games in their second round series; this gave them their first taste of postseason success since moving to Memphis. After winning a franchise record 56 games during 2014–15 season (including a club-record 19 straight wins), they suffered another playoff heartbreak when they lost to Courtney Lee and Jeff Teague’s Atlanta Hawks 4–2 in Round 1 despite being up 2–1 early on</p>
<h1 id="Raptors-aim-to-improve-on-dismal-betting-odds"><a href="#Raptors-aim-to-improve-on-dismal-betting-odds" class="headerlink" title="Raptors aim to improve on dismal betting odds"></a>Raptors aim to improve on dismal betting odds</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors tee off the 2017-2018 NBA season as one of the most intriguing teams in the league. The squad has undergone a few changes over the offseason and many pundits have them pegged for a breakout year. The oddsmakers, however, are not quite as bullish on the Raptors and have set the team’s betting odds at +2000 to win the title.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to back Toronto at these odds, there are several reasons to be optimistic about their chances this season. First and foremost, the Raptors boast an impressive starting five that features All-Star guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. They will be joined by Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas, and newcomer C.J. Miles who is coming over from Indiana. This unit has the potential to be one of the best scoring lineups in the league.</p>
<p>Toronto also has a deep bench that features plenty of talent, including Jakob Poeltl, Norman Powell, Delon Wright, Fred VanVleet, and Pascal Siakam. Head coach Dwane Casey has plenty of options at his disposal and should be able to matchup with any team in the league.</p>
<p>The Raptors are also one of the most experienced squads in the NBA. They have players who have been through playoff battles and know how to win games when it matters most. This could pay dividends down the stretch when other teams start to wear down.</p>
<p>There are certainly some concerns with this squad as well. Most notably, they lack a true superstar player who can take over a game when things aren’t going their way. Lowry and DeRozan are both very good players but they don’t have that Kobe or LeBron type of mentality when it comes to taking over a game. This could be costly if they find themselves in a tight playoff series against one of the top teams in the league.</p>
<p>All in all, there is plenty of upside with this Raptors squad heading into next season. If they can gel together quickly and play up to their potential, they could certainly make some noise in the Eastern Conference playoffs. At +2000 odds, now may be as good a time as any to jump on board with Toronto as they look poised for a breakout year</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-eyeing-playoffs-after-strong-offseason-How-to-bet-on-the-games"><a href="#Toronto-eyeing-playoffs-after-strong-offseason-How-to-bet-on-the-games" class="headerlink" title="Toronto eyeing playoffs after strong offseason; How to bet on the games?"></a>Toronto eyeing playoffs after strong offseason; How to bet on the games?</h1><p>Toronto Raptors had an impressive offseason by adding Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. The duo has already made an impact on the court, leading the Raptors to a 2-0 record.</p>
<p>Toronto is now eyeing a playoff berth and there are several ways to bet on their games. Let’s take a closer look at the betting options and how to make money on the Raptors this season.</p>
<p>Point Spread Betting</p>
<p>The most popular form of betting on the NBA is Point Spread betting. This type of bet is placed on who will cover the point spread, which is set by oddsmakers.</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors are currently favored by 6.5 points over the Chicago Bulls. If you think they will win by more than 6.5 points, you would wager on Toronto -6.5. If they only win by 6 points or less, your bet would lose even though they covered the spread.</p>
<p>If you think Chicago may pull off the upset, you can wager on them +6.5 points. In this case, if Chicago wins or losses by 5 points or less, your bet would be a winner.</p>
<p>Moneyline Betting</p>
<p>Another popular way to bet on NBA games is through Moneyline betting. This type of bet simply predicts who will win the game outright, without taking into account the point spread.</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors are currently listed as -270 favorites against the Chicago Bulls (+220). This means that for every $100 you wager on Toronto, you would earn $37 in profit if they win straight-up (less any juice&#x2F;commissions). On the other hand, a successful $100 wager on Chicago would net you a total return of $220.</p>
<p>Over&#x2F;Under Betting</p>
<p>You can also bet on whether there will be more or less than a certain number of points scored in a game by using Over&#x2F;Under betting lines. In this scenario, oddsmakers will set a total number of points that they believe will be scored in the game combined by both teams.</p>
<p>For example, if the Over&#x2F;Under line is set at 214 points for tonight’s game between Toronto and Chicago, it means that oddsmakers believe214or more will be scored in total during the game (combined by both teams). If you think that there won’t be that many points scored, you would wager Under 214 points. Vice versa, if you think that there will be more than 214points scored in tonight’s game, then you would place a wager on Over 214points.</p>

Here’s how you can bet on it.5. Find out the latest betting odds for the Toronto Raptors and how to make the best bets for their games."></a>Can the Raptors make a serious run at the NBA Championship? Here’s how you can bet on it.5. Find out the latest betting odds for the Toronto Raptors and how to make the best bets for their games.</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors had a great season last year, but they were ultimately defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. This year, they’re looking to make a serious run at the NBA Championship, and it’s worth betting on them to do so.</p>
<p>To begin with, the Raptors have good odds of winning the NBA championship this year. In fact, they’re currently listed as the 4th favourites to win it all at 8&#x2F;1 odds. This puts them behind only the Golden State Warriors (2&#x2F;9), Cleveland Cavaliers (5&#x2F;4), and San Antonio Spurs (10&#x2F;3). If you’re looking to make a bet on the Raptors, these are some of the best odds you’ll find.</p>
<p>In addition to their favourable odds, the Raptors also have a very talented squad that can give any team in the league a run for its money. Led by superstar DeMar DeRozan, this team is capable of beating anyone on any given night. They also have a number of other quality players, including Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka, and Jonas Valanciunas.</p>
<p>With all of that said, there are a few things to keep in mind when betting on the Toronto Raptors this season. First of all, their schedule is going to be difficult. They’ll be facing off against some of the best teams in the league every night, so they’ll need to be playing their best basketball if they want to make a deep run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Secondly, injuries could be a concern for this team. They’ve already lost Ibaka for an extended period of time due to injury, and if other players start getting injured then it could spell trouble for them later on in the season.</p>
<p>Despite these potential problems, I still think that the Toronto Raptors have what it takes to win the NBA championship this year. With their talent and favourable odds, now is a great time to bet on them!</p>
