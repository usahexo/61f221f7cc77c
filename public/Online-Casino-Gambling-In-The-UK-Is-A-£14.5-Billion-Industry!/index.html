        <h1 id="Online-Casino-Gambling-In-The-UK-Is-A-£14-5-Billion-Industry"><a href="#Online-Casino-Gambling-In-The-UK-Is-A-£14-5-Billion-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Online Casino Gambling In The UK Is A £14.5 Billion Industry!"></a>Online Casino Gambling In The UK Is A £14.5 Billion Industry!</h1><p>The UK gambling industry is booming, with online casino gambling now accounting for almost two-thirds of total wagers. In fact, the industry is now worth a whopping £14.5 billion annually!</p>
<p>The rise in popularity of online casino gambling can be put down to a number of factors. For starters, there’s the convenience and flexibility that comes with gambling online. You can log on from anywhere at any time, and you don’t have to queue up or dress up to enjoy a few rounds of your favourite games.</p>
<p>Then there’s the vast range of games available. You can find pretty much any type of game you want to play, including slots, roulette, blackjack, poker and even bingo. This means that there’s something for everyone – whether you’re a casual gambler or a hardcore enthusiast.</p>
<p>In addition, online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than traditional betting shops. So if you’re looking to win big, then an online casino could be just the place for you!</p>
<p>Of course, with great rewards come great risks too. So it’s important to do your research before signing up with any online casino. Make sure to read reviews and compare different casinos to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>With so many options out there, it has never been easier (or more fun) to gamble online in the UK!</p>
<h1 id="Brits-Lose-Nearly-£1-Billion-A-Year-Gambling-Online"><a href="#Brits-Lose-Nearly-£1-Billion-A-Year-Gambling-Online" class="headerlink" title="Brits Lose Nearly £1 Billion A Year Gambling Online"></a>Brits Lose Nearly £1 Billion A Year Gambling Online</h1><p>An increasing number of Brits are gambling online, but they may not be as savvy as they think. A new report from the UK Gambling Commission has found that British adults lose nearly £1 billion (£968 million) a year gambling on the internet. That’s £190 for every adult in the country.</p>
<p>The biggest losers are those who gamble on sports betting and casino games. These two types of gambling account for more than two-thirds of the total losses. Sports bettors lost an average of £553 each, while casino players lost an average of £292.</p>
<p>Slot machines were the next biggest losers, with players losing an average of £206 per year. This is particularly concerning given that slot machines are often seen as being among the most addictive forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The report also found that men are more likely to lose money gambling than women. Men lost an average of £291 a year, while women lost £157. This is likely due to the fact that men are more likely to bet on sports and play casino games.</p>
<p>The UK Gambling Commission urges people to gamble responsibly and to only gamble what they can afford to lose. It also recommends that people set financial limits for themselves and stick to them.</p>
<h1 id="Shock-Stats-Online-Casino-Wagers-Now-Totaling-Over-£100-Billion-A-Year"><a href="#Shock-Stats-Online-Casino-Wagers-Now-Totaling-Over-£100-Billion-A-Year" class="headerlink" title="Shock Stats: Online Casino Wagers Now Totaling Over £100 Billion A Year"></a>Shock Stats: Online Casino Wagers Now Totaling Over £100 Billion A Year</h1><p>Casinos are big business, and the online variety are no exception. A recent study by market research firm Juniper Research has found that online casino wagers now total over £100 billion a year. That’s more than twice the amount wagered in 2010.</p>
<p>Much of this growth can be attributed to the increasing popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices. Casino apps are now among the most popular downloads, and players can enjoy all the action from anywhere they happen to be.</p>
<p>Another factor fueling this growth is the increasing legalization of gambling around the world. Countries such as the United States and Australia have been particularly eager to expand their casino offerings in recent years.</p>
<p>The Juniper Research study also found that the average online casino player now spends over £2,000 a year on wagers. So if you’re looking for some exciting action, an online casino might just be the place for you.</p>
<h1 id="UK-Casino-Gambling-Booming-–-Over-£30-Billion-Wagered-In-2016-Alone"><a href="#UK-Casino-Gambling-Booming-–-Over-£30-Billion-Wagered-In-2016-Alone" class="headerlink" title="UK Casino Gambling Booming – Over £30 Billion Wagered In 2016 Alone"></a>UK Casino Gambling Booming – Over £30 Billion Wagered In 2016 Alone</h1><p>The gambling industry in the UK is booming, with over £30 billion wagered in 2016 alone, according to figures from the Gambling Commission. The growth in online and mobile gambling is a big factor in this, with more people than ever using their phones or laptops to place bets.</p>
<p>The biggest sector of the gambling industry is casino gambling, which accounted for over £13 billion of the total amount wagered in 2016. This figure is up by almost 5% on the previous year, and there seems to be no sign of things slowing down – especially with the advent of new virtual reality casinos.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of controversy surrounding online casino gambling in recent years, as some people have raised concerns that it can lead to addiction and other problems. However, the overall trend seems to be that it is becoming increasingly popular, especially among younger players.</p>
<p>This popularity is perhaps not surprising when you consider all the attractions that casino gambling has to offer. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re a fan of traditional table games such as blackjack and roulette, or prefer the excitement of modern slot machines. And with so many different variations of each game available, you can always find something new to try.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, online casinos often offer generous bonuses and rewards schemes which can add an extra element of excitement to your play. So if you’re looking for some excitement and entertainment then why not give casino gambling a try? You might be surprised at just how much fun it can be!</p>
<h1 id="Record-Breaking-Year-For-Online-Casino-Gambling-In-The-UK-–-More-Than-£40-Billion-Waged"><a href="#Record-Breaking-Year-For-Online-Casino-Gambling-In-The-UK-–-More-Than-£40-Billion-Waged" class="headerlink" title="Record-Breaking Year For Online Casino Gambling In The UK – More Than £40 Billion Waged"></a>Record-Breaking Year For Online Casino Gambling In The UK – More Than £40 Billion Waged</h1><p>The amount gambled online by Britons in 2017 smashed through the £40 billion mark for the first time, new figures have shown.</p>
<p>According to the Gambling Commission’s latest statistics, released on Thursday (28 December), UK residents wagered a total of £40.7bn via gambling websites and apps in the year. This was an increase of 11% on the £36.5bn figure for 2016 and represented almost half (48%) of all the money staked on gambling products in the country last year.</p>
<p>Spurred on by a succession of jackpot hits – including November’s massive £24m payout on Microgaming’s Mega Moolah slot – casino gambling continues to grow in popularity among UK punters. Slot machines were once again the most popular form of online gambling, accounting for nearly two-thirds (64%) of all GBP wagers last year.</p>
<p>In terms of amounts gambled, video poker was the biggest category in 2017, with players staking £2.9bn on the games. This was followed by blackjack (£1.8bn), roulette (£1.6bn) and bingo (£1.4bn). The average British player lost a total of £592 over the course of the year, up from £548 in 2016.</p>
<p>Responding to the latest figures, Gambling Commission CEO Neil McArthur said: “These figures show that online gambling is increasingly popular with UK consumers who are wagering billions of pounds on games of chance and skill every year. Our job is to make sure that consumers are protected whether they are playing at home or abroad, and we will continue to work hard with our partners to ensure that industry meets our high standards.”</p>
<p>The news comes as no surprise given that online casino gaming is now one of the most popular pastimes in Britain, alongside watching television and browsing social media sites. With more people than ever before enjoying a flutter on their favourite slots or table games, it looks likely that 2018 will see another record-breaking year for online casino gambling in the UK.</p>
